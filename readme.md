## Steps
### Environment setup- .env
Create `.env` file from the .env.example file in the same directory. Adjust the secrets in env file accordingly.
### Database setup
start the postgres database with docker:

`docker-compose up -d`.

You can also start the database using pgAdmin or any other tool.
### Database migrations
We are using `Prisma` as the ORM in this project. To create the schema in your database, you will have to apply the migrations (located in /prisma/migrations folder). Run this command to apply migrations: 

`yarn prisma migrate dev`

 if you are using `npm` or `pnpm` just replace yarn with your package manager name in the above command

### Start the application ðŸŽ‰
`yarn start`

## APIs
To see the api documentation or run the endpoints on a browser go to `/api-docs` route, e.g. if your application is running locally on port `3000`, visit *`localhost:3000/api-docs`* on your browser.
